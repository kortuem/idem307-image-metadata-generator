photo of ide_drawing_studio A wide-angle, eye-level shot of an empty art studio classroom with an industrial aesthetic, dominated by a large arched barrel-vault ceiling with exposed metal trusses and translucent skylight panels that cast bright, diffuse daylight over the space, featuring a dark grey floor with rows of white-topped individual drafting tables and simple adjustable stools with wooden seats arranged on two different levels, all facing a teaching area at the back with a chalkboard and a long wall of frosted glass cabinets, creating a functional, quiet, and well-lit atmosphere
