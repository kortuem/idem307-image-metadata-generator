This tutorial will guide you through preparing your image dataset for FLUX LoRA fine-tuning on Replicate.com.

---

## What You'll Need

‚úÖ **20-40 images** of the same subject/space (JPG or PNG format)
‚úÖ **Access code** from your instructor (or your own Gemini API key)
‚úÖ **~10-15 minutes** of time

---

## What This Tool Does

The Image Metadata Generator automatically creates detailed, AI-generated captions for your images in the format required by Replicate.com for FLUX LoRA training.

**Example caption:**
```
TU Delft drawing studio with high vaulted ceilings and skylights, rows of white
adjustable drawing tables with wooden stools, dark flooring, translucent partition
walls, abundant natural light creating bright functional workspace
```

Each image gets a unique, descriptive caption starting with your semantic context. Replicate handles trigger words automatically during training.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Images

**Image Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **Format**: JPG, JPEG, or PNG
- ‚úÖ **Quantity**: 20-40 images (Replicate recommends 12-20, but more is better)
- ‚úÖ **Resolution**: Minimum 512x512, ideally 1024x1024 or larger
- ‚úÖ **Aspect ratio**: Any aspect ratio works - Replicate auto-resizes
- ‚úÖ **Size**: Max 10MB per image (100MB total upload)
- ‚úÖ **Subject**: All images of the SAME subject/space/person

**Tips for good training data:**
- Use high-resolution images (1024x1024+ recommended)
- Include close-ups AND wide shots
- Capture different angles, lighting, and perspectives
- Show variety in settings and compositions
- Ensure images are sharp and well-lit (not blurry or dark)
- Different aspect ratios are fine - no need to crop

---

### Step 2: Open the Tool

Go to: **https://idem307-image-metadata-generator.onrender.com/**

**First time?** The page may take 20-30 seconds to load (the server "wakes up" from sleep). This only happens if nobody has used it recently.

---

### Step 3: Upload Your Images

1. Click the **upload area** (or drag and drop images)
2. Select 20-40 images from your folder
3. Wait for upload to complete (~5-10 seconds)
4. You'll see: **"‚úì Uploaded X images"**

**What happens:**
- Images are validated (correct format, not corrupted)
- Thumbnails are created for preview
- Upload progress bar shows percentage

---

### Step 4: Select Image Category

Choose the category that best matches your images:

- **Interior/Architecture** - Rooms, spaces, interior environments
- **Person/Portrait** - Individual person photos
- **People/Groups** - Multiple people, group activities
- **Object/Product** - Items, tools, designed objects
- **Vehicle/Machine** - Cars, bikes, robots
- **Exterior/Building** - Building facades, architectural exteriors
- **Scene/Landscape** - Nature, outdoor scenes
- **Abstract/Artwork** - Sketches, diagrams, digital art

This ensures the AI uses the right descriptive vocabulary for your images.

---

### Step 5: Enter Semantic Context

**What is semantic context?**
A short description that will start every caption. This helps the AI understand what it's looking at.

**Examples:**
- For IDE Main Hall: `TU Delft main hall`
- For a lecture room: `Lecture room B`
- For a person named John: `John Smith`
- For your design studio: `Modern design studio`

**Rules:**
- ‚úÖ Max 50 characters
- ‚úÖ Be specific and descriptive
- ‚úÖ Will appear at start of every caption

**Type your semantic context** in the "Semantic Context" field.

---

### Step 6: Enter Access Code

In the **"Gemini API Key or Access Code"** field:

**Option A - Use Instructor's Code:**
- Enter the access code provided by your instructor
- For IDEM307 students: `idem307_2025`

**Option B - Use Your Own API Key:**
- Get a free API key at: https://aistudio.google.com/
- Sign in with Google account
- Click "Get API Key" ‚Üí "Create API Key"
- Copy and paste into the field

---

### Step 7: Generate Captions

1. Click **"Generate Captions"** button
2. Watch the progress: **"Processing X of Y..."**
3. Each image takes ~5-10 seconds to process
4. Total time: ~4-8 minutes for 30 images

**What's happening:**
- AI analyzes each image using category-specific prompts
- Generates detailed description starting with your semantic context
- Saves caption for export

**Optional - Slow Mode:**
If the server is busy or you see errors, check the **"üê¢ Slow Mode"** box. This adds a 3-second delay between requests.

**‚òï Take a break!** Come back in 5-10 minutes.

---

### Step 8: Review Captions (Optional)

After generation completes:

1. Click on any thumbnail to see its caption
2. Edit the caption if needed (click in text area)
3. Changes save automatically
4. Use arrow keys to navigate between images

**Most captions are good!** You typically only need to edit 10-20% of them.

**When to edit:**
- Caption is too generic
- Missed important details
- Incorrect description
- You want to emphasize something specific

---

### Step 9: Export Training ZIP

1. Click **"Preview Metadata"** to see all captions (optional)
2. Click **"Export Training Data"**
3. Download the ZIP file
4. File name: `[semantic_context]_training.zip`

**What's in the ZIP:**
```
tu_delft_drawing_studio_training.zip
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.txt          ‚Üê Caption for image1
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image2.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image2.txt          ‚Üê Caption for image2
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Each image has a matching `.txt` file with its caption. **No README.txt** - just images and captions ready for Replicate.

---

### Step 10: Upload to Replicate

1. Go to: https://replicate.com/
2. Sign in (create account if needed)
3. Navigate to **FLUX LoRA training**
4. Upload your ZIP file
5. Enter your **trigger word** (e.g., `ide_main_hall`)
6. Start training!

**Important**: Replicate adds your trigger word automatically during training. Your captions don't include it - that's correct!

**Using your trained model:**
When generating images, use prompts like:
```
ide_main_hall with students working
ide_main_hall at sunset
ide_main_hall empty and quiet
```

The AI will generate images in the style of your training data!

- Use access code: `idem307_2025` (for IDEM307 students)
- Or get your own free API key: https://aistudio.google.com/

### "Captions not generating"
**Solution**:
- Wait ~8-12 seconds per image (using Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify you entered semantic context and API key/access code
- Try refreshing and starting over

### "Download doesn't work"
**Solution**:
- Check your browser's download folder
- Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Disable ad blockers temporarily
